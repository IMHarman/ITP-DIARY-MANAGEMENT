As the name suggests the Personal Dairy Management System is used to store the personal data of an individual person. We can store data like person name, mobile number, address, date of birth, living place, etc.

You can also store important pieces of information like meeting information and various other tasks. This project is completely error-free. This project uses the method of file handling to store the data in the file.

In addition to the view, edit and delete the record you have to enter the password first. The password is not required to view the main menu or to add record. The password is used in other mini-projects.

The only difference is that we can edit the password within the application. Your password is enter which means press the enter key.

# ENJOY ADDING YOUR MOMENTS 😊😊
